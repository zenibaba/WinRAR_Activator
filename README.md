# WinRAR Activator

Say goodbye to the annoying "trial period expired" pop-up in WinRAR. This simple, one-click script will register your copy of WinRAR and get rid of the nagging license notifications.

### Why use this method?

* **Simple & Fast:** Instantly activates WinRAR with a single command.
* **Persistent:** Your license stays active even after WinRAR updates.
* **No File Modification:** The script only adds a valid license key, leaving your original installation untouched.

### How to Activate

#### **PowerShell (Windows 10/11)**

1.  Open PowerShell or Terminal. You can do this by right-clicking the Start menu.
2.  Copy and paste the command below, then hit Enter:

    ```

The script will automatically run and complete the activation process.

#### **Command Prompt (Windows 7/8/8.1)**

1.  Download the **`WAS.cmd`** file directly from this repository.
2.  Right-click the downloaded file and select **"Run as Administrator"**.

#### **Manual Activation (All Windows Versions)**

If the script method doesn't work for you, you can manually activate WinRAR with these steps:

1.  Download the **`rarreg.key`** file from this repository.
2.  Copy the file.
3.  Navigate to your WinRAR installation folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\WinRAR\`) and **paste** the file there.
4.  Close any open WinRAR windows and open it again. The "trial" message should be gone.

### Troubleshooting

* **Uninstall First:** If you previously used a pre-cracked or repackaged version of WinRAR, make sure to completely uninstall it before using this script. If you have trouble, a tool like Revo Uninstaller can help you remove stubborn files and registry entries.
* **Use the Official Version:** This script is designed to work with the official, original WinRAR installation. You can download the latest version from the official website: [**https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm**](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)
* **Still Having Trouble?** If you run into any issues, please create an issue on this repository, and I'll do my best to help you out.
